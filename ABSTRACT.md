Authors introduce the **Vehicle Dataset for YOLO**, a meticulously curated collection of labeled images that assembles a diverse range of vehicle types, rendering it a valuable resource for computer vision and object detection enthusiasts. This dataset consists of a total of 3000 images, with 2100 designated for *train* and 900 for *valid*. It has been constructed by amalgamating data from various sources, including Kaggle, the [Stanford Car Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/stanford-cars), and web scraping, ensuring a rich and varied set of examples. This dataset encompasses six distinct classes: *car*, *threewheel*, *bus*, *truck*, *motorbike*, and *van*, presenting numerous opportunities for the development and refinement of YOLO-based models tailored for vehicle detection tasks.
