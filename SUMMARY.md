**Vehicle Dataset for YOLO** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the smart city industry. 

The dataset consists of 3000 images with 3830 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *car*, *motorbike*, *threewheel*, and other: *van*, *bus*, and *truck*.

Images in the Vehicle Dataset for YOLO dataset have bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2100 images) and *valid* (900 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
